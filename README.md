**Hello there ðŸ‘‹**

I am Kato, also known as Katomints. I'm currently proficient in Lua, and Python. I am currently learning JavaScript, and will learn C++ soon.
My main hobbies are Automotives, technology, developing / coding and architecture.

My main goal is to become a Software Developer / Engineer, which is why I also like making codes that somewhat might be useful and open-source releasing them onto my GitHub for people to use.
