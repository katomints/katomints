**Hello there ðŸ‘‹**

I am Iann, I'm currently proficient in Lua, Python, and NodeJS, eventually will start learning C++ .
My main hobbies are Automotives, technology, developing / coding and architecture.

My main goal is to become a Software Developer / Engineer, which is why I also like making codes that somewhat might be useful and open-source releasing them onto my GitHub for people to use.
